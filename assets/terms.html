                    <p>Dear valued member of the community,</p>
                    <p>This Plain Language Statement and Consent Form outlines the purpose and scope of our research project. Please read the following information carefully.
                    <p><strong>Purpose: This research project aims to quantify the nature and extent of alcohol, cigarette, food/drink and gambling advertising that children are exposed to on their route to or from primary and secondary schools.</strong> This will be done using SCANNER, an app that we have developed for citizens to capture images of product advertisements and contribute to a growing image library. We will apply Artificial Intelligence techniques to this image library to ultimately develop the first-ever automated system for monitoring unhealthy advertising to children. Such monitoring can inform policy changes that are urgently needed to protect children from this kind of commercial exploitation.</p>

                </p>
                <p><strong>Your role:</strong> We are recruiting parents/carers of children in primary or secondary school. Parents/carers will be asked to collect images or videos of food, alcohol, tobacco, and gambling advertising as they are on route (walking, driving, or taking public transport) to their child/ren’s school/s. This will include outdoor ads on public transport, billboards, shopfronts, sports venues, etc. Some examples include: </p>

                <p>This data collection can be done once-off and should only add a few extra minutes to your normal commute to your child’s school.</p>
                <p>As you collect images of advertisements, we may ask you tag the products being advertised (e.g. type of unhealthy food/drink, tobacco, alcohol, etc.). We will also collect the geolocation of where your pictures were captured to assess the distance of adverts from schools and differences in advertising across areas. Geolocation data will not be linked to personal information or used to identify your personal location. Please do not capture images of people and ensure that you only capture images when it is safe to do so (i.e. images should NOT be captured while driving. If you drive to your child’s school, you should safely park your vehicle and capture the images).</p>
                <p>Once you have provided consent to participate in our study, you will be asked to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Complete an initial 5-10 minute survey (essential) to collect background information about you and your attitudes to the app and food/drink, alcohol, gambling, and tobacco advertising,</li>
                    <li>Download our SCANNER app and watch a video tutorial on how to use the app to capture images of advertisements (essential; or attend a short briefing/interview with a researcher if necessary),</li>
                    <li>Complete a 5-10 minute survey (essential) once you have completed data collection</li>
                </ol>

                <p>We may also ask you to complete a focus group (1 hour/non-essential) with a researcher and other participants at the end of the study to discuss experiences with collecting advertising data for the study.</p>
                <p>Once your participation in this study is complete, you will be provided with a $20 sports voucher for your time. </p>

                <p><strong>Benefits and risks:</strong> Participation in this research project will help us to advance our understanding of the extent and nature of unhealthy advertising that children are exposed to on their route to or from school. A better understanding of the exposure of unhealthy product advertising is important to inform and evaluate policies that can effectively reduce this exposure, particularly among children, in Australia and internationally.</p>

                <p>This study will also advance the technology that is available to monitor unhealthy advertising to children. Unhealthy advertising has been recognized globally as a risk factor for unhealthy attitudes and behaviours across the life-course. Leading health bodies, including Cancer Council Victoria, the World Cancer Research Fund International, and the World Health Organization consistently recommend that governments take regulatory actions to reduce the influence of unhealthy advertising – but few governments have implemented these types of policies to date.</p>

                <p>The benefits of participating in this project outweigh any foreseeable risks. The only foreseeable risk may be the inconvenience of using your time to take pictures of advertisements and complete surveys, a briefing/interview and a focus group (optional).</p>

                <p><strong>Privacy and confidentiality:</strong> To protect your privacy and confidentiality, and that of third parties, the following apply to the images or videos that you upload to our crowdsourcing platform:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Identifiable features:</strong> All identifiable features should be obscured by participants using the edit/brush tool on the app and will be obscured in any published research reports unless they are publicly available (i.e. faces in advertisements).</li>

                    <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Do not take images or videos in settings where photography is prohibited or inappropriate. These include, but are not limited to, some workplaces, banks, medical centers, swimming pools, bathrooms, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities, military institutions and airport security. Pictures should NOT be captured while you are driving.</li>

                    <li><strong>Inappropriate material:</strong> If images or videos depict illegal or inappropriate activities, they will be removed by the research team and the relevant authorities will be notified in accordance with the law. These may include (but are not limited to) texting and driving, drinking and driving, taking illicit substances, criminal damage, sexual violence, child abuse and hate crimes.</li>

                    <li><strong>Data storage and access:</strong> All data will be securely stored on locked drives at Deakin University. Only members of the research team and collaborators who receive ethics approval and have a common vision to improve population health will have access to the image library.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Research reports and publications:</strong> All research outputs will report on findings in an aggregated form. Whilst the general public will not have access to the data you provide, advertising examples may be published. In this event, any identifiable features (e.g. faces) that are not publicly available will be obscured.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you would like to receive research updates and findings, please provide your email at the end of this Plain Language Statement.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Project management and monitoring:</strong> The research team (which consists of highly skilled public health and IT researchers) led by A/Prof Kathryn Backholer will meet fortnightly to discuss and manage this project. Annual reports will also be submitted to the Deakin University ethics committee.</p>

                <p><strong>Data custodianship and copyright:</strong> Participants will reserve the right to use their images and videos as they like. However, Deakin University will be the custodians of the combined, crowdsourced image library. The researchers will hold all copyright of the research publications.</p>

                <p><strong>Funding:</strong> This research is funded by Cancer Council Victoria and Deakin University. The research team also receives funding from the National Heart Foundation and VicHealth. The researchers have no conflicts of interest to declare.</p>

                <p><strong>Withdrawing your participation:</strong> Participation in this research project is voluntary. You have the right to withdraw from the study at any stage prior to data analysis. Please contact a member of the research team (details below) if you would like to withdraw your data. Your withdrawal or non-participation will not affect your relationship with Deakin University, the researchers or funding bodies.</p>
